\section{Conclusion}

We completed the assignment with the recommended approach given in the
compendium. By doing this, we learnt how programming a microcontroller
in C is done, as well as doing interrupt handling and memory-based I/O
on an AVR32. In addition, we decided to use a sine wave to generate
sound, which required more work than any of the other waves we could
have used instead. By doing this, we learnt how to bypass computation
heavy sound generation by either pregenerating a single period of a tone
just before it is needed, or by pregenerating all tones used at the
start of the program. 

As we were not completely satisfied with the noise generated during
``silence'', we tested out many different ways to try to solve the issue.
However, though we were unable to solve the problem, we found a plausible reason
for the noise, as well as a possible solution. Unfortunately, we did not
have time enough to try out this solution, as it required a major
refactoring.
