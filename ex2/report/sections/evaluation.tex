\section{Evaluation of the assignment}

This was the first time any of the group members have programmed in C
directly on a processor without any operating system in between, and it
was educational to experience problems we have not encountered in other
environments.  Issues such as declaring variables volatile to ensure they
are written to memory was one of them, and how interrupts are enabled
and set was another. It was also interesting to experience and solve
actual issues with real time constraints, such as not being able to
calculate sine values at runtime.

However, not every part of this task was as rewarding. It was
frustrating to spend a lot of time on issues we later found out were
hardware limitations. We found this to be more annoying than
educational. However, this is an issue we now will be more familiar with
in the future.

It was also hard to debug sound errors, mostly because we did not know
where the error occured -- was it a mathematical error, issues with real
time constraints or issues with hardware limitations? None of the group
members have had to deal with the two latter problems before, and thus
we had to think outside our normal debug scope. This was however very
educational and gave us insight in issues and errors one will have to
consider in embedded systems.
