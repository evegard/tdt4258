\section{Evaluation of the assignment}

This was the first time any of the group members have programmed in C
directly on a processor without any operating system in between, and it
was nice and educational to experience problems we have not experienced
in other environments.  Issues such as setting variables volatile to
ensure they are written to memory was one of them, and how interrupts
are enabled and set was another. It was also fun to see and solve
actual issues with real time constraints, such as not being able to
calculate sine at runtime.

However, not every single part of this task was as fun as hoped. It was
frustrating to use a lot of time on issues we later found out were
hardware limitations, and while it was good to experience issues with
hardware, we found it to be a bit more annoying that educational.  This
is most likely personal grudges we assume fade away with time, as this
issue will be more familiar and known in the future.

It was also hard to debug sound errors, mostly because we did not know
where the error occured. Is it a mathematical error we have done, is it
issues with real time constraints, or is it issues with hardware
limitations? None of the group members have had to deal with the two
latter problems before, and thus we had to think outside our normal
debug scope. This was however very educational and gave us insight in
issues and errors one will have to consider in embedded systems.
