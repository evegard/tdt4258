\section{Introduction}

This report has been written so that the authors will get a better
understanding on how to program in C, how I/O control and interrupt
handling is done for AVR32 in C, and how to use the AVR32's audio
bitstream digital to analog converter (ABDAC) for sound generation. The
task given to us in the course Microcontroller System Design (TDT4258)
to learn these things was to ``Write a Câ€“program which runs
directly on the STK1000 board [\ldots] and which plays different sound
effects when different buttons are pressed. [\ldots] The requirement is
that you use an interrupt routine to pass the samples to the ABDAC.''\cite{comp}

The task was solved incrementally, as all authors have had good experience
with incremental development of programs in previous projects. Through
an incremental approach of trying and testing, we could easily pinpoint where and when a bug
in our program was introduced, and could thus eliminate them relatively
fast. We also used the AVR32's internal ABDAC, as that was a
recommendation from the compendium.

We decided to use equal temperament, due to the ease of implementing
songs and tunes as we are already familiar with it. We chose to use sine
waves in order to generate smooth tones, and because it posed a greater
challenge. This forced us to generate a sound buffer in order to make
the interrupt handler fast enough.
