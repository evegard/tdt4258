An operating system will provide an abstraction such that receiving
and sending data is made easy for programmers. However, to have such an
abstraction for a specific piece of hardware, one needs a device driver.
This report shows how to implement such a character device driver for
Linux on the STK1000 board. The driver will make it possible to read
which buttons are pressed on the board as well as writing which LEDs
should be on and off. The report will also explain how to use device
drivers through an implementation of the game Scorched Land in C. The
game will use the driver implemented to read buttons and turn on and off
the LEDs, a sound driver to play different sounds, and a frame buffer
device driver to print the game on to the screen on the board. The
report will also include problems we believe others may make, and
solutions to those problems.
