\section{Evaluation of the assignment}

This assignment was a good introduction on how to work with Linux, as
well as how to implement and use kernel drivers on a microcontroller.
The assignment gave us the opportunity to learn more about both how
graphics and sound are rendered correctly, and how many components need
to work together to make a final product.

As this is our third assignment, being more familiar with the hardware
and certain aspects of the software allowed us to work on a larger
project than earlier.

The assignment provided not only technical knowledge and insight, but
also experience with relatively large C projects where one has to design
an interface for others to use and plan functionality of the code prior
to its implentation. As both are highly relevant for students studying
complex computing systems, we found the assignment very rewarding.
