\section{Conclusion}

In this assignment, we started out by implementing a kernel driver for
the buttons and LEDs on the STK1000 board, before we implemented a game
through usage of the previously implemented device, a sound device and a
frame buffer device.

Most of the issues in this assignment were related to hardware
limitations and assumptions about specifications which we later found
out were wrong. For instance, we had to tune the sampling rate on the
files as well as in the sound driver settings so that the sounds played
at correct speed, and we had to bit-shift because the endianness of the
TGA-files and the frame buffer were different.

In the end, all of the difficulties we encountered were overcome. The
resulting game is quite playable, and the overall design of the game
components and the interaction between the game and the kernel driver
are well-defined and tidy.
