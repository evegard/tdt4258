This project was performed to get a better understanding on how the
AVR32 microprocessor from ATMEL handles io and interrupts at the
processor level. It was also performed to gain a better understanding on
how programming at assembly level is done. This was done by creating a
small program in assembly in which the user is able to control the
position of an LED-paddle by pressing buttons.
