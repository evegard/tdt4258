\section{Conclusion}

We successfully completed the assignment as per specification, and
learnt something very useful about implementing input from analog
buttons or switches. Before this, we had not heard about contact
bouncing and the problems it could cause.

After this assignment, we have become familiar with some simple usage of
common development tools such as \texttt{make}, \texttt{gdb},
\texttt{as} and \texttt{ld}. We have successfully used assembly language
to program a microcontroller, and used interrupt-based I/O to detect
button pushes and control LEDs. Through a carefully laid out program
flow, we've managed to eliminate all obvious errors that could arise.
