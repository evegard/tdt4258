\section{Results and Test}
We did not have a formal testing protocol during this assignment. We completed the code in two stages - one to familiarise ourselves with the function of the LEDs, and one to handle interrupts. The first stage consisted of a lot of trial-and-error coding in an attempt to make the row of LEDs cycle, and at what speed. Implementing this was a good way to practise turning the correct LEDs on and off, making sure it looped, and making them cycle at the right speed. Testing, here, mainly consisted of changing something, and observing whether the LEDs on the microcontroller behaved correctly.

The second stage consisted of implementing our interrupt routine. At this point, we took the opportunity to tidy up our code and document it.
