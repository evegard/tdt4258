\section{Evaluation of the Assignment}

This was a suitable challenge for computer science students who has not
worked with processors at an assembly level before. It required some
``try-and-fail''-methodology in order to solve the assignment, which we
consider a good way to learn the architecture of the microprocessor
and the programs that comes with it.

It was easy to know where to start, and it was easy to try out a small
program and then develop that small program into a solution to the
assignment without having to redesign the whole thing. It was also easy
to test whether the assembly code you had programmed worked as intented
through the usage of {\em STK1000 development board} and the {\em GNU Debugger}.

The assignment consisted of practical and useful experience which felt
relevant considering the study line and future courses. It seems likely
that we sometime in the future will need what we learnt during the
execution of the assigment outside of this course.

To write such a thorough report is relatively new for the members of our
group, so we are a little uncertain on how thorough the report is
supposed to be. An example report for some assignment in the same field
would be great to have, so that we would know whether we're doing it
right or not. The expected report length could also have been specified.
