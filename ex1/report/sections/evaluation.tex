\section{Evaluation of the Assignment}

This was a suitable challenge for computer science students who have not
worked with processors at an assembly level before. We needed to use ``trial and error'' methods to solve the assignment, and we
consider this a good way to learn about the architecture of a microprocessor
and the programs used in development of microprocessor software.

It was easy to know where to start thanks to the good assignment description, and we could try out a small
program and then develop that small program into a solution to the
assignment without having to redesign the whole thing. It was also easy
to test whether the assembly code you had programmed worked as intented
through the usage of {\em STK1000 development board} and the {\em GNU Debugger}.

The assignment provided practical and useful experience that feels
relevant considering the study line and future courses. It seems likely
that we will need what we learnt during the
execution of the assigment sometime in the future.

Writing such a thorough report is a relatively new activity for the members of our
group, so we were a little uncertain as to how thorough the report was
supposed to be. An example report for some assignment in the same field
would useful, so that we would know whether we're doing it
right or not. The approximate expected report length could also have been specified.
